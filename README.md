# ArUCo-Markers-Pose-Estimation-Generation
This repository contains all the code you need to generate an ArucoMarker, detect ArucoMarkers in images and videos, and then use the detected Marker to estimate the pose of the object. In addition to this, I have also included the code required to obtain the calibration matrix for your camera.
